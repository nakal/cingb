- fixed sound support in some places
  (really stupid bugs! but noone really
   could help me about it!)
  the sound is still a bit "aggressive",
  but there is (still) lots to do
- made sound frequency selectable;
  default: 22050

------------------------------------------------------------
Revision 0.22ALPHA   2001/03/29 nakal

------------------------------------------------------------
Revision 0.21ALPHA   2001/02/26 nakal

unix.c:
- BUG# 223276 fixed (Sun Solaris 2.7 DefaultGC)

------------------------------------------------------------
Revision 0.20ALPHA   2000/11/24 nakal

unix.c:
- inserted #define's for MIT_SHM
- it seems XFlush is not needed after
  X(Shm)PutImage, I think it could
  mean: more performance (?)

configure:
- update for non-XShm-systems
- replaced locate-commands with test -r
  commands for finding header/lib-files

Global:
- testing needed for Solaris still
  in progress

------------------------------------------------------------
Revision 0.19ALPHA   2000/11/22 nakal

unix.c:
- now using XShm-routines (accelerated
  graphics output)

Makefile:
- fixed libsocket+libnsl on some systems

sgb.c, sgb.h:
- new in this version, they give some
  ideas how the SGB support could
  work (packet-transfer and SGB
  detection)
- now only for debugging purposes      

Global:
- testing needed for Solaris

------------------------------------------------------------
Revision 0.18ALPHA   1999/10/24 nakal

Done some changes to unix.c:
- now you can quit by pressing "ESC" or "q"
  (fb & glide mode)
- tty switching is supported now (fb mode)

Implemented action-replay support.
- new files: actionreplay.c actionreplay.h

------------------------------------------------------------
Revision 0.17ALPHA   1999/10/24 nakal

Implemented tcp/ip support for dialog
link (-DDIALOGLINK, only EARLY-ALPHA):
- full support for io-ports 0x01 and 
  0x02

First support for /dev/audio on Solaris.
- 8-bit-PCM support (DOESN'T WORK FOR NOW !)

Fixed games:
- Centipede (cgb):
  highest palette bit is in use (!) Now 
  it will be stored.
- Tarzan (cgb):
  HDMA5, bit 7 will be set when general
  purpose transfer ends
- Klax (cgb)
  fixed horizontal HDMA
- Zebco Fishing (cgb)
  fixed other HDMA problems,
  src/dst address-update
  HDMA should work fine now.

------------------------------------------------------------
Revision 0.16ALPHA-3 1999/10/09 nakal

Improved the cgb-cartridge detection
routine. Needed for:
- Tetris DX

Implemented new switch "-f" for 
forcing the standard (b/w) gameboy 
mode.

Made first steps for /dev/audio on
SVR4 systems (needs testing; no release
so far)
------------------------------------------------------------
Revision 0.16ALPHA-2 1999/10/07 nakal

Fixed bug in gameboy.c:
- Pokemon works again

Updated configure:
- gives warnings about missing devices,
  like /dev/fb0, /dev/js0
------------------------------------------------------------
Revision 0.16ALPHA   1999/10/02 nakal

First official ALPHA release !
The sound still slows everything down.

Fixed rom bank selection code (MBC5).
It seems that addressing memory
(0x3000-0x3FFF) selects something else.
Perhaps, higher rom-bank-bits ???
Will check this, if I see a cart > 2MB.

Fixed:
- Asteroids
- Zebco Fishing (partial)

Different sound updates:
- sound mode 4 implemented (hmm, bad!)
- added sweep to channel 1 (good!)
  io-port: 0x10, now full support
- better timing
- when 0xFF is written to sound-freq-low,
  the sound is switched off now
- fixed sound gain level 
  (was 0, must be 128 when quiet !)

------------------------------------------------------------
Revision 0.15ALPHA-2 1999/10/01 nakal

Updated cart-type information:
- included type 0x10 as MBC5

New game works:
- Harvest Moon (gbc)

Checked Klax ... Nocash says it uses
HuC1, but ... it works.

------------------------------------------------------------
Revision 0.15ALPHA   1999/09/24 nakal

Implemented sound support:
- mode 1 (without envelope and sweep 
  functions)
  IO-ports:
  - NR11 (full)
  - NR13 (full)
  - NR14 (partial)
- mode 2 (without envelope)
  IO-ports:
  - NR21 (full)
  - NR23 (full)
  - NR24 (partial)
- mode 3 (buggy; awful)
  - NR30 (full)
  - NR31 (full)
  - NR32 (full)
  - NR33 (full)
  - NR34 (partial)
  - wave pattern RAM: 0xFF30-3F (full)
- master IO-ports:
  - NR50 (partial)
  - NR51 (partial)
  - NR52 (partial)
- 11kHz, but adjustable (see sound.c)

Remark:
The sound can be enabled by passing "-s" on the
command-line.
Don't get surprised, if the sound gets annoying
for your ears ! It's *LOW* quality and this is
an ALPHA-release ! 
The sound slows down the emulation!

Updated Makefile[.templ].
- defined dependencies removed redundant rm's

Updated files:
- gameboy.* (io-regs 0x10-0x3F implementation)
- unix.*    (linux sound support)

New files:
- README.FAQ (frequently asked questions)
- sound.c, sound.h (sound implementation)

------------------------------------------------------------
Revision 0.14       1999/09/24 nakal

Implemented Glide support (only 1 mode
is available: 640x480x16, double-size).
It is much faster than the X-support in
double-size mode.

Improved framebuffer support. This was
an incredible speed-up ! Now it works
even faster than the Glide version.

Removed -DDOUBLESIZE size from sources;
instead implemented command-line option
'-d'. Now you needn't recompile the sources,
if you want to switch between the big and
small version.

Makefile.templ rearranged:
- removed release2, debug2
- added glide

main.c:
- implemented command options support
- updated help command

gameboy.c:
- scanlinexxx() functions improved

unix.c:
- lcdbuffer allocation improved
- removed scanlines-support for the 
  framebuffer and the glide version
- optimized framebuffer-copy routines
  (memcpy was too slow!)
------------------------------------------------------------
Revision 0.13  1999/09/23 nakal

Fixed the problems with HDMA in vblank-
mode. Now it provides realtime vblank
support, which allows to run more games
with decent graphics (CGB).

Figured out the bug about tetris 2 player 
mode (!). Now it should work fine.

Gave all source files a little information
header (for novices).

CGB-games fixed:
- Pitfall
- Bugs Life
- Rugrats
- Antz
- Spy Vs Spy

STDGB-game fixed:
- Tetris
------------------------------------------------------------
Revision 0.12  1999/09/22 nakal

Added a configure script, that figures out
three things about your system, I hope ...
- endian structure (little/big)
- joystick support (yes/no)
- framebuffer support (yes/no)

Added a joypad/-stick button configuration
program. Now you needn't change the sources
on your own.

Updated the 'clean'-routine in Makefile.templ,
so that it will recover all source files from
modifications. Now it also will delete the
binaries, so that you can easy make a tarball
and pass the original files to your friends.

Oops! found a small bug in joypad configuration
routines: the buttons A and B were swapped !
Corrected this crap.

New files added to CVS:
Makefile.templ
configure
conftest.c
joybtn_conf.c
joyconf.h
joyconf.h.sidewinder

Removed from CVS:
Makefile
------------------------------------------------------------
Revision 0.11  1999/09/19 nakal

Rewritten the entire color interpretation
routines. Now it should work on more
PCs (hope all of them).
------------------------------------------------------------
Revision 0.10b 1999/09/13 nakal

Gameboy COLOR fixes:

-implemented support for 8 bit X-displays
 (keep in mind: Gameboy COLOR has 15(!) bits,
  so try to use higher resolutions)
-implemented endian-check
-wrote a short explanation for the debugger

File added to CVS:
DEBUGGER
------------------------------------------------------------
Revision 0.10a 1999/09/05 nakal

Gameboy COLOR fixes:
- fixed Super Mario Deluxe
  (now testing if bit 7 in 0:0x143 is set:
   then enable cgb support)
- fixed Pokemon Pinball (cartridge type: 0x1E)
- HDMA needs to be fixed
  you really need realtime behaviour
............................................................
Revision 0.10 1999/09/05 nakal

Gameboy timings improved:
- clock tables
- interrupt timing (vblank,lcdc)
- fixed Bomberman 3 (vblank timing)
- fixed Castlevania 2 (port 0xFF40 bit 1 fixed)
............................................................
Revision 0.9  1999/09/01 nakal

Basic gameboy color functions implemented!
Now cingb detects some of the special
color carts. Only the new cartridges will
be played in color mode.

To be done: 
- MBC5 timer functions
- window alignment

I need help with:
- SOUND!
............................................................
Revision 0.6-0.8  1999/07/02 16:40:16  nakal

Optimizations.
............................................................
Revision 0.5d 1999/07/01 

Sun Solaris appearantly has an older SVR4
standard, which doesn't handle signals like
linux. Now should be fixed, I hope.
............................................................
Revision 0.5c 1999/06/24 

Implemented real time support for faster
machines. Now, the emulator is synchronized
with the screen refresh (appox. 50 Hz).
Changes in: unix.c
Due to these changes, cingb refuses to run on
Sun Solaris. Why ? 
There is a problem with sys/time.h...
I don't know the particular issues.
Next week, I'll check this out.
............................................................
Revision 0.5b  1999/06/21 

It's a cool framebuffer version (ALPHA!, 
don't forget). Changes mostly made to 
unix.c. 

IMPORTANT (only FB version): It is possible, 
that you don't get the fb-version started. 
Make sure, you have a 24 or 32 bits graphics 
mode on your terminal (these are ones 
providing the best compatibility). You can 
try 15/16 modes, too, but ...
There is also one more problem: you MUST
have a joypad/-stick installed for playing
with it.
............................................................
Revision 0.5  1999/06/03 15:23:47  nakal

Beautified the sources, now it should
be easier to work with them.
Now cingb consists of modules.
(It's pretty cool to watch the sources
 compile, one after another !)
Added/changed some comments.
Changed the location of some functions.
New headers: globaldefs.h, z80opc.h
Removed: main.h (was empty now)
Prototypes corrected.
............................................................
Revision 0.4  1999/04/25 19:10:12  nakal

Fixed RLCA, RRCA, RLA, RRA opcodes.

Result:
Mystic Quest, Darkwing Duck fixed.
............................................................
Revision 0.3  1999/04/23 18:23:03  nakal

Done a little fix to BIG ENDIAN machines. Now it 
should work, I hope.

Result:
Sparc processor support.
............................................................
Revision 0.2  1999/04/13 18:55:32  nakal

Fixed interrupt flag resetting (IM), which
set IF to zero after first EI.
Allowed delayed LCDSTAT interrupts.
Implemented definitions for system w/o
a joystick. See: README

Result:
Alfred Chicken, Killer Instinct fixed.
............................................................
Revision 0.1  1999/04/11 18:08:31  nakal

Fixed the behaviour of the sound flags (0xFF26).
cingb now keeps bits 0-3 set for approx. 1 sec.

Result:
Bart Simpson's Escape From Camp Deadly now works.
............................................................
Revision 0.0                       nakal

Completely rewritten the old dos-cingb.
